# MergeThatSort
This is my mips assembley language project for my computer orgnaization class. The goal of this program is to implement a simple merge sort using assembley language. 

Merge Sort in MIPS: Sorting with a MIPS-terious Twist!

Welcome to the world of MIPS, where the assembly lines are buzzing, and our merge sort is ready to dazzle you with its algorithmic acrobatics! 🧙‍♂️✨

In this program, we’ve trained our MIPS assembly wizards to perform the ancient art of merge sorting. Imagine tiny elves meticulously dividing and conquering your array, splitting it into neat halves and then merging them back together in perfect order. It’s like a magical dance, but with less glitter and more binary!

Here’s what happens behind the scenes:

1) Divide and Conquer: Our MIPS code slices the array in half like a master sushi chef. 🍣
2) Recursive Magic: Each half is sorted by recursively calling our tiny MIPS sorcerers to work their magic. 🔮
3) Merge Mayhem: Finally, the sorted halves are merged together, piece by piece, like assembling a giant LEGO masterpiece. 🧩

So, sit back, relax, and let our MIPS program sort things out for you. It's sorting, but with a twist of MIPS-terious fun! 🎩✨
